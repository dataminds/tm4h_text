## Psychological Well-Being: How to Be Happy

What is happiness? How can we be happy? These are some of the questions that many people ask themselves and try to answer. Happiness is a complex and elusive concept that can be defined and measured in different ways. One of the ways to approach happiness is to consider it as a function of psychological well-being.

Psychological well-being (PWB) is a term that refers to the positive aspects of human functioning and experience. It involves various dimensions of human flourishing, such as self-acceptance, personal growth, purpose in life, environmental mastery, autonomy, and positive relations with others. PWB is more than just the absence of problems or symptoms; it is the presence of strengths and potentials.

PWB can be seen as a function of happiness, because it involves the factors and processes that contribute to or enhance happiness. Happiness can be conceptualized as subjective well-being (SWB), which reflects how people evaluate and experience their own lives. SWB consists of three components: life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect. Life satisfaction is the cognitive component of SWB, which reflects how people judge their overall quality of life and satisfaction with specific domains. Positive affect and negative affect are the emotional components of SWB, which reflect how often and intensely people feel pleasant and unpleasant emotions and moods.

In this essay, I will explain what PWB is, how it is measured, what factors influence it, and what benefits it has. I will also give some examples and tips on how to improve your PWB and happiness.

## What Is PWB?

PWB is a broad and multidimensional concept that includes six main dimensions: self-acceptance, personal growth, purpose in life, environmental mastery, autonomy, and positive relations with others.

### Self-acceptance

Self-acceptance is the state of embracing yourself as you are, without judging or rejecting any aspect of yourself. It means acknowledging your strengths and weaknesses, your successes and failures, your virtues and flaws, and accepting them all with compassion and kindness.

Some examples of self-acceptance are:

- Forgiving yourself for your mistakes and learning from them, instead of dwelling on them or punishing yourself.
- Appreciating your unique personality, talents, and abilities, instead of comparing yourself to others or wishing you were different.
- Respecting your needs and preferences, and honoring them in your choices and actions, instead of suppressing or denying them.
- Expressing your true feelings and opinions, without fear of rejection or criticism, while also being respectful of others.
- Celebrating your achievements and successes, no matter how big or small, instead of dismissing or minimizing them.
- Loving your body and appearance, without obsessing over flaws or imperfections, while also taking care of your health and well-being.


### Personal growth

Personal growth reflects how people develop and realize their potential. It involves having a sense of continued improvement, learning new skills and knowledge, seeking new challenges and opportunities, and being open to change.

Some examples of personal growth are:

- Learning a new skill, such as playing an instrument, speaking a foreign language, or coding. This can enhance one's abilities, creativity, and confidence.
- Focusing on one's physical well-being, such as exercising regularly, eating healthily, or sleeping well. This can improve one's mood, energy, and resilience.
- Learning about different cultures, perspectives, and values. This can broaden one's horizons, increase one's empathy, and foster respect for diversity.
- Working on one's patience, tolerance, and forgiveness with others. This can strengthen one's relationships, reduce conflict, and promote harmony.
- Setting and pursuing meaningful goals that align with one's values and passions. This can provide direction, motivation, and purpose in life.


### Purpose in life

- Purpose in life is the dimension of PWB that reflects how people find meaning and direction in their lives. It involves having a sense of coherence, goals, values, and motivation, and being able to pursue what matters to oneself.

Purpose in life means having a sense of direction, meaning, and goals in life, as well as beliefs that give life purpose. Purpose in life is important for enhancing one’s motivation, resilience, and happiness.

Some examples of purpose in life are:

Pursuing a career or vocation that aligns with one’s values and passions, such as teaching, nursing, or art. This can provide a sense of fulfillment, contribution, and achievement.
Engaging in activities or hobbies that bring joy and satisfaction, such as gardening, reading, or playing chess. This can provide a sense of enjoyment, creativity, and relaxation.
Participating in causes or movements that make a positive difference in the world, such as volunteering, donating, or campaigning. This can provide a sense of altruism, solidarity, and impact.
Exploring one’s spirituality or faith and finding connection with a higher power or a larger reality. This can provide a sense of transcendence, hope, and gratitude.
Developing and nurturing relationships with family, friends, and community that are supportive, meaningful, and loving. This can provide a sense of belonging, intimacy, and love.



### Environmental mastery

Environmental mastery reflects how people manage their external world. It involves having a sense of control, competence, and adaptability, and being able to create favorable conditions for oneself and others.

Some examples of environmental mastery are:

- Organizing and decluttering one's home or workspace, such as by following the KonMari method¹ or the 5S system². This can improve one's productivity, comfort, and well-being.
- Setting and maintaining healthy boundaries with others, such as by saying no to unwanted requests, expressing one's needs and preferences, and avoiding toxic people. This can protect one's energy, autonomy, and self-respect.
- Seeking and using resources that can help one achieve one's goals, such as by taking online courses³, reading books⁴, or joining clubs or communities⁵. This can expand one's knowledge, skills, and network.
- Taking charge of one's finances, such as by budgeting, saving, investing, or earning extra income. This can increase one's security, freedom, and opportunities.
- Making positive changes in one's environment, such as by planting trees, recycling waste, or supporting causes. This can make a difference in the world, help others in need, and develop a sense of purpose.



### Autonomy

Autonomy reflects how people regulate their own behavior. It involves having a sense of independence, self-determination, and freedom, and being able to act according to one's own preferences and values.

Some examples of autonomy are:

- Setting boundaries in a relationship to protect your values. For instance, you might say no to your partner's request to do something that goes against your beliefs or preferences, and explain why it is important for you to stay true to yourself.
- Getting up early each morning to go for a run because you enjoy doing it. This shows that you are motivated by your own interests and goals, rather than by external pressures or expectations. You also demonstrate your ability to manage your time and health effectively.
- Signing up for a community softball team because you enjoy playing. This indicates that you are willing to explore new opportunities and experiences that match your passions and values. You also show your independence and confidence in joining a group of people who share your interests.
- Making decisions about things you want by researching your options. For example, you might compare different models and prices of laptops before buying one that suits your needs and budget. This implies that you are capable of making informed and rational choices that reflect your personal preferences and circumstances.


### Positive relations with others

- Positive relations with others reflects how people interact with other people. It involves having a sense of trust, intimacy, affection, and support, and being able to form and maintain satisfying and meaningful relationships.

Some examples of positive relations with others are:

- Maintaining a healthy and loving relationship with a spouse or partner, such as by communicating openly, expressing appreciation, and resolving conflicts constructively. This can provide a sense of intimacy, security, and happiness.
