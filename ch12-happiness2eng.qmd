# Happiness: Functions and Indicators

## Functions and Indicators

Happiness is a complex and elusive concept that has been studied by various disciplines, such as psychology, philosophy, economics, and sociology. One way to approach happiness is to conceptualize it as functions and indicators. Functions are the processes or mechanisms that produce or enhance happiness, while indicators are the measures or outcomes that reflect or represent happiness. In this essay, I will discuss the idea that subjective well-being is the indicator of happiness, and psychological well-being is the function of happiness.

## Subjective well-being (SWB): Indicator
Subjective well-being (SWB) is a term that refers to how people experience and evaluate different aspects of their lives. It involves three components: life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect. Life satisfaction is the cognitive component of SWB, which reflects how people judge their overall quality of life and satisfaction with specific domains. Positive affect and negative affect are the emotional components of SWB, which reflect how often and intensely people feel pleasant and unpleasant emotions and moods.

SWB can be seen as the indicator of happiness, because it captures people's own perceptions and feelings about their lives. SWB is subjective, because it depends on people's own standards and criteria, not on objective or external factors. For example, two people might have the same income level, but one might be more satisfied with their life than the other, because they have different expectations or values. SWB is also dynamic, because it can change over time and across different situations. For example, your life satisfaction might increase after achieving a goal or receiving a reward, but it might decrease after facing a challenge or a loss.

## Psychological well-being (PWB): Function
Psychological well-being (PWB) is a term that refers to the positive aspects of human functioning and experience. It involves six dimensions: self-acceptance, personal growth, purpose in life, environmental mastery, autonomy, and positive relations with others. Self-acceptance is the dimension of PWB that reflects how people view themselves and their past. Personal growth is the dimension of PWB that reflects how people develop and realize their potential. Purpose in life is the dimension of PWB that reflects how people find meaning and direction in their lives. Environmental mastery is the dimension of PWB that reflects how people manage their external world. Autonomy is the dimension of PWB that reflects how people regulate their own behavior. Positive relations with others is the dimension of PWB that reflects how people interact with other people.

PWB can be seen as the function of happiness, because it involves the factors and processes that contribute to or enhance happiness. PWB is more than just the absence of problems or symptoms; it is the presence of strengths and potentials. 

## Conclusion 
Therefore, SWB and PWB are two complementary perspectives on happiness. SWB tells us how happy we are, while PWB tells us how to be happy. By measuring SWB, we can assess our current level of happiness and identify areas for improvement. By enhancing PWB, we can increase our happiness and well-being in various domains of life. By understanding both SWB and PWB, we can pursue a more balanced and fulfilling life.
